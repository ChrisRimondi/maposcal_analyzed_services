It details an incident reporting mechanism, utilizing a generic email address, with an implied process for confidential investigation, suggesting a need for robust incident logging and auditing. From a source-code security perspective, the primary risk is the complete absence of technical security controls like authentication, authorization, input validation, or encryption. Relying on a shared email for sensitive reports raises availability, integrity, and audibility concerns. A noted TODO is the potential for further, separately documented enforcement policies.",

A significant security risk is the explicit warning against operating in \"debug\" mode in production environments, as this can lead to sensitive information disclosure, including detailed error messages and internal route structures. The file also warns about the non-thread-safe nature of `SetHTMLTemplate()`, highlighting a potential race condition if not initialized correctly.

    "summary": "This file provides a thin wrapper around Go's standard `encoding/json` library for JSON serialization and deserialization, serving as a fallback implementation. It offers no direct security controls such as authentication, authorization, or encryption, nor does it incorporate compliance-relevant features like logging or IAM role integration. The primary security risk is the complete absence of application-level input validation; `Unmarshal` only handles JSON parsing, leaving the critical task of validating deserialized data content entirely to the caller, which can lead to vulnerabilities if neglected. No explicit TODOs are identified within this module.",
