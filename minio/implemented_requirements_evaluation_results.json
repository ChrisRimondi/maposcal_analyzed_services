        "status_alignment": "The status 'applicable but only satisfied through configuration' accurately reflects that MinIO itself does not handle time synchronization but relies entirely on the host OS configuration, consistent with the explanation and statement.",
        "explanation_quality": "The explanation clearly states that MinIO depends on the host OS for time sync, referencing the importance of synchronized clocks for security features like token expiration and auditing, which aligns well with the control's intent.",
        "configuration_support": "The configuration section is specific and valid, citing concrete file paths and keys (/etc/ntp.conf server at line 12 and /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf NTP at line 8) that demonstrate how time synchronization is configured on the host system.",
        "overall_consistency": "All parts\u2014the status, explanation, configuration, and statement\u2014are coherent and reinforce each other without contradiction, providing a unified understanding of how the control is implemented and satisfied."
      },
      "recommendation": "Consider including brief evidence excerpts or summaries from the specified configuration files to strengthen traceability and demonstrate the actual configuration values in use; additionally, clarifying the frequency or monitoring of time synchronization could improve completeness."
