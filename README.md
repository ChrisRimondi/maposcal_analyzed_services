# MapOSCAL Analyzed Services

This repository contains the output of security and compliance analysis performed by the MapOSCAL tool on various open source services. The analysis includes detailed security overviews, requirements mapping, and compliance assessments for popular open source projects.

## üìã Contents

This repository contains analyzed data for the following services:

- **Caddy** - Modern web server with automatic HTTPS
- **Gin** - High-performance HTTP web framework for Go
- **MinIO** - High-performance object storage
- **NATS Server** - Cloud native messaging system

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each service directory contains:

- `meta.json` - Detailed metadata and content analysis
- `security_overview.md` - Comprehensive security assessment
- `implemented_requirements.json` - OSCAL requirements mapping
- `implemented_requirements_evaluation_results.json` - Evaluation results
- `unvalidated_requirements.json` - Requirements that couldn't be validated
- `validation_failures.json` - Details of validation failures
- `config_files.json` - Configuration file analysis
- `index.faiss` - Vector index for semantic search
- `summary_index.faiss` - Summary vector index
- `summary_meta.json` - Summary metadata

## üîç What is MapOSCAL?

[MapOSCAL](https://github.com/ChrisRimondi/MapOSCAL) is a tool that analyzes open source software to:

1. **Security Assessment** - Evaluate security controls, authentication mechanisms, encryption, and data protection
2. **Compliance Mapping** - Map software features to OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) requirements
3. **Documentation Generation** - Create comprehensive security overviews and compliance reports

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using the Data

The data in this repository can be used for:

- **Security Research** - Understanding how different open source projects implement security controls
- **Compliance Analysis** - Mapping software features to regulatory requirements
- **Risk Assessment** - Identifying potential security gaps in software
- **Educational Purposes** - Learning about security implementation patterns

## üìä Data Format

### Security Overview (`security_overview.md`)

Structured markdown containing:
- Service overview and architecture
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Encryption and data protection
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Compliance considerations

### Requirements Mapping (`implemented_requirements.json`)

JSON format mapping software features to OSCAL control requirements:
- Control IDs and descriptions
- Implementation status
- Evidence and rationale
- Risk assessments

### Metadata (`meta.json`)

Detailed analysis metadata including:
- File content analysis
- Code structure information
- Security-relevant findings
- Compliance mappings
