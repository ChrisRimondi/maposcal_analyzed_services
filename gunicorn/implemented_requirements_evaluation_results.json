This would strengthen the evidence for how the component contributes to 'preserving system state information,' even if the primary failure mechanisms are inherent. Additionally, while not a direct Gunicorn configuration, referencing the typical systemd service file configuration (e.g., `Type=notify`) that leverages Gunicorn's `sd_notify` capability could enhance clarity on how the inherent feature is put into practice."
