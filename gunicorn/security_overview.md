# Security Summary

## 1. Service Overview
Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP server designed to serve Python web applications. Its main purpose is to act as a low-level server, delegating application-level security concerns such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to the deployed WSGI application or an upstream proxy.

The server operates with a master process and multiple worker processes, utilizing a pre-fork worker model that offers process isolation. It manages HTTP request parsing, WSGI environment creation, and response handling. Gunicorn supports various worker types, including synchronous, asynchronous, gthread, gaiohttp, gevent, eventlet, and tornado workers. It can be embedded within other applications.

Gunicorn is written in Python and uses standard Python libraries such as `configparser`, `logging`, `hashlib`, `base64`, `socket`, `struct`, `os`, `sys`, and `re`. It incorporates or adapts components from Eventlet (for debugging), greins (for reloading), and Vinay Sajip's logging configuration. The service supports listening on both TCP sockets (IPv4 and IPv6) and Unix sockets.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization
Gunicorn does not implement application-level authentication mechanisms; this responsibility is delegated to the WSGI application it hosts or an upstream proxy. It processes and logs malformed basic authentication headers in access logs.

For authorization, Gunicorn supports privilege separation by allowing worker processes to run under a different user and group ID (uid/gid) than the master process, with the master process retaining its permissions while workers operate with reduced privileges. It utilizes `umask` for setting file permissions. The service includes checks for file ownership before attempting to access files and ensures that users retain access to logs after privilege dropping. Gunicorn provides settings for `proxy_allow_ips` and `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` to specify trusted proxies for the proxy protocol and forwarded headers, and it enforces security by forbidding contradictory secure scheme headers.

Gunicorn does not manage identity directly beyond process UID/GID assignment. Session handling is not a feature of Gunicorn and is expected to be managed by the application it serves. Access control implementation within Gunicorn is primarily based on file and process permissions and source IP whitelisting for proxy-related headers.

## 3. Encryption and Data Protection
Gunicorn does not manage data encryption at rest. For data in transit, Gunicorn supports SSL/TLS for encrypted communication. It provides options to configure SSL settings and allows the use of custom SSL headers, such as `X-Forward
