However, it lacks built-in authentication, authorization, input validation, or explicit security headers; these must be implemented by middleware or handlers. There are no evident compliance features like logging, auditing, or IAM role integration within this wrapper\u2014although middleware support allows their insertion. The design assumes users will add necessary security controls externally. No TODOs or direct security risks are visible, but the absence of default security mechanisms and reliance on user-supplied middleware could lead to misconfigurations or insecure defaults if not carefully managed.",

Logging and auditing are well-covered with configurable log formats, file logging, and route logging hooks. Encryption is demonstrated in TLS support with Let's Encrypt integration.
