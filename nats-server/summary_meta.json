    "summary": "The file defines a comprehensive set of error, debug, and informational messages related to OCSP-based TLS certificate validation, emphasizing mutual TLS enforcement and OCSP peer cache management. It supports security controls like TLS client/server verification with OCSP checks, cache compression, and response freshness validation. Logging is extensive, covering cache lifecycle events, OCSP response status, and verification results, aiding auditing and compliance. The presence of policy override logs indicates configurable fail-open behaviors. However, no direct input validation or IAM role enforcement is evident, and the reliance on cache integrity and external OCSP responders introduces potential risks if caches become stale or responders are unreachable. No explicit TODO items appear, but careful monitoring of cache states and OCSP availability is critical to prevent security bypass.",

    "summary": "The file implements an OCSP response fetcher with input validation for non-nil parameters and configurable HTTP client timeout, enhancing reliability. It uses standard cryptographic functions to create OCSP requests and supports multiple responder endpoints, improving availability. However, there is no explicit authentication or authorization for the OCSP request or response, nor is there encryption beyond standard HTTPS client usage, which may expose it to MITM risks if not properly secured externally. Logging is present for debugging but lacks structured auditing or sensitive data masking, which could be a compliance concern. No IAM roles or access controls are enforced within this code. Error handling is robust but some TODOs could include enhancing security by validating OCSP responses cryptographically and improving audit logging for compliance.",

    "summary": "The file provides no-op implementations for assertion functions used in testing, lacking any active security controls such as authentication, authorization, encryption, or input validation. It contains no compliance-related features like logging, auditing, or IAM role enforcement. Being a stub for when a specific build tag is absent, it poses no direct security risks but also offers no security assurance or error handling. The absence of functional assertions could lead to missed test failures or undetected security issues in builds relying on this file, representing a potential risk if used in production contexts without the intended SDK enabled.",

  "/Users/chrisrimondi/Code/nats-server/internal/ldap/dn.go": {
    "summary": "The file implements LDAP distinguished name (DN) parsing and comparison following RFC standards, focusing on attribute extraction and DN structure manipulation. It includes input validation when parsing strings and certificate subjects, rejecting unsupported BER encoding and invalid attribute types or values, which mitigates malformed input risks. However, it lacks explicit authentication, authorization, encryption, or logging/auditing mechanisms, serving purely as a utility for DN handling. The presence of a FIXME comment suggests incomplete attribute mapping, which may lead to unrecognized OIDs and parsing errors. No IAM roles or compliance-specific controls are evident, and there are no clear TODOs beyond the attribute type expansion. Overall, the code is low risk but should be integrated with secure context controls and enhanced error handling for production use.",

    "summary": "This file provides lock-free fast random number generation functions without any security controls such as authentication, authorization, encryption, or input validation. It lacks compliance features like logging, auditing, or IAM role enforcement. The use of low-level linking hints at performance optimization but offers no indication of cryptographic strength or resistance to prediction, posing a potential risk if used for security-sensitive randomness. There are no TODOs or comments addressing security considerations, making it unsuitable for cryptographic or security-critical applications without further enhancement.",

    "summary": "The file implements a thread-safe dummy logger primarily for testing, supporting multiple log levels and optional message retention. It includes synchronization controls to prevent race conditions but lacks direct security controls like authentication, authorization, or encryption. The logger facilitates compliance-relevant features such as detailed logging and message aggregation, enabling tests to verify log content and detect prohibited entries, which supports auditing efforts. However, it is intended solely for test environments and does not integrate with IAM roles or secure storage. No input validation is performed on log messages, posing a minimal risk confined to testing contexts. There are no explicit TODOs or indications of security vulnerabilities, but the logger\u2019s use should be restricted to non-production code to avoid exposing sensitive information.",

It uses cryptographic operations to parse certificates, sign OCSP responses, and validate signature chains, ensuring integrity and authenticity of responses. There is no encryption for HTTP transport, and no logging or auditing features are present, limiting compliance with security monitoring requirements. Input validation is minimal and focused on OCSP request parsing and integer status values, but lacks protections against replay or injection attacks.

Data retention is unlimited with no message size or count limits, posing a storage risk. Replication is set to three, offering some durability, but encryption or access logging features are absent, limiting auditability and compliance with data protection standards.

Retention and storage settings allow unlimited message size and counts, which may risk data overconsumption or unauthorized data retention. Deletion and purge operations are permitted, potentially exposing data to accidental or malicious removal. Logging or auditing features are absent, limiting traceability and compliance with data governance standards. The configuration uses a single replica and disables rollup headers, which may affect data integrity and recovery. Overall, the lack of access controls, encryption, and auditing presents notable security and compliance risks, and the presence of default or unlimited limits signals a need for tighter controls and explicit policies.",
