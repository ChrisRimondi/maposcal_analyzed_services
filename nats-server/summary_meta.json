It enforces read-only or inaccessible paths for sensitive data, restricts network address families, and uses private namespaces and temporary directories to isolate the process. While authentication and authorization are likely handled in the NATS server config (not shown), this unit focuses on hardening and minimizing the attack surface. Compliance features include resource limits and optional accounting for auditing purposes. No explicit logging or IAM roles are configured here. There are comments suggesting further hardening (e.g., locking /etc areas), and a TODO to tune resource controls or memory limits externally, highlighting areas for potential improvement.",

    "summary": "The file implements subject transformation logic for message routing with strict validation of source and destination subjects to prevent malformed mappings, enforcing syntax correctness and wildcard usage rules. While it lacks direct authentication or encryption features, it enforces authorization-like controls by validating transform configurations and rejecting unsupported or invalid mappings. Compliance-wise, it does not include explicit logging or auditing mechanisms or IAM role integration, relying on upper layers for caching and locking. Potential risks include TODO notes for unexpected edge cases in reverse transformation and limited error handling for some token parsing scenarios, which could lead to silent failures or misconfigurations. Input validation is thorough for subject formats but does not address broader security controls such as injection prevention or runtime access control.",

    "summary": "The file provides a lock-free fast random number generator interface by linking to runtime functions, offering 32-bit and 64-bit unsigned integers. It lacks explicit security controls such as authentication, authorization, encryption, or input validation. There are no compliance-related features like logging, auditing, or IAM role enforcement. The reliance on runtime functions for randomness suggests potential risks if these are not cryptographically secure, making it unsuitable for security-sensitive contexts without additional safeguards. No TODOs or comments indicate planned improvements or known issues.",

  "internal/ocsp/ocsp.go": {
    "summary": "This file implements a test OCSP responder with basic input validation and concurrency control via mutexes but lacks robust authentication or authorization on its status-setting HTTP endpoints, posing a risk of unauthorized status manipulation. It supports certificate parsing and OCSP response generation with configurable TTL and HTTP method preferences. While it includes TLS-related OCSP response verification and signature checks, it does not log or audit actions, nor enforce IAM roles or other compliance mechanisms. The in-memory status map and exposed endpoints without access controls represent potential security weaknesses, especially for production use. No encryption beyond OCSP signing is applied, and TODOs or explicit security hardening steps are absent, indicating this is primarily a test utility rather than a hardened service.",
