    "summary": "The file implements OCSP-based certificate status validation as a security control, supporting peer authentication and revocation checking with configurable timeouts, clock skew allowances, and response handling options (e.g., warn-only mode, treating unknown status as good). It includes input validation for OCSP URLs and certificate chain parsing to prevent invalid data use. Compliance features include structured logging hooks and detailed status assertions for auditing certificate validity and delegation checks per RFC 6960. The design avoids defaulting to trusted states by handling unknown or missing OCSP responses cautiously. No explicit encryption or IAM roles are managed here. While robust, a potential risk is reliance on external OCSP responders\u2019 availability; the allow-when-CA-unreachable option may unintentionally weaken enforcement if misused. No explicit TODOs or insecure code patterns are present.",

Compliance features include detailed logging and auditing of OCSP cache operations, response validity, and connection rejections, aiding traceability and incident investigation.

No encryption is applied beyond the use of HTTPS implied by the URLs, and no input sanitization is done on responder URLs beyond trimming slashes, potentially risking injection if inputs are untrusted.
