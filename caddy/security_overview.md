# Security Summary

## 1. Service Overview

**Main purpose and functionality:**  
The service is a robust, production-ready HTTP server and reverse proxy with support for automatic HTTPS, dynamic configuration, distributed tracing, metrics, and a modular architecture. It features automated certificate management (including ACME, internal CA, and Encrypted ClientHello), reverse proxying with load balancing, health checks, and support for various HTTP protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3).

**Key architectural components:**  
- HTTP server with routing, middleware, and automatic HTTPS
- TLS management (automation, certificate loaders, session ticket service)
- Reverse proxy module with load balancing, health checks, header manipulation, and upstream selection policies
- PKI application for internal CA management
- ACME server for certificate issuance
- Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry
- Metrics collection (admin and HTTP endpoints)
- Admin API for configuration and operational endpoints

**Technical stack and dependencies:**  
- Go (memory-safe language)
- [certmagic](https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic) for certificate management
- [libdns](https://github.com/libdns/libdns) for DNS provider integrations
- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for tracing
- [prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) for metrics
- [smallstep/certificates](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) for ACME/authority modules
- [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) for routing in ACME server
- [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) for structured logging
- [cpuid](https://github.com/klauspost/cpuid) for hardware detection (cipher suite selection)
- [cloudflare/circl](https://github.com/cloudflare/circl) for cryptographic primitives (ECH)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics exposure

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication mechanisms:**  
- HTTP Basic Authentication middleware with configurable user accounts and bcrypt password hashing.
- Supports secure password comparison (constant-time) and mitigates timing side-channels via fake password generation.
- Optional in-memory password hash cache to improve performance under load.

**Authorization models and policies:**  
- No built-in role-based access control or fine-grained authorization in HTTP handlers or admin endpoints.
- Authorization logic is primarily encapsulated within authentication modules (e.g., basic auth).
- ACME server supports issuance policies via allow/deny lists on domains and IP ranges.

**Identity management:**  
- Basic user account management via static configuration for HTTP Basic Auth.
- User identity is available via request context placeholders after authentication.

**Session handling:**  
- TLS session resumption is managed via a session ticket service with configurable key rotation, max keys, and rotation interval.
- Session ticket keys are generated using a secure pseudorandom source (crypto/rand). Key rotation is enabled by default.

**Access control implementation:**  
- Reverse proxy and file server endpoints do not enforce access controls by default; access control is delegated to authentication middleware if configured.
- Admin API endpoints (including /metrics and /reverse_proxy/upstreams) do not enforce authentication or authorization checks in the code provided.
- No explicit IAM role enforcement or endpoint whitelisting/blacklisting is presentâ€”exposure must be managed via external server configuration.

## 3. Encryption and Data Protection

**Data encryption at rest:**  
- Certificates and keys are stored using [certmagic.Storage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/caddyserver/certmagic#Storage), defaulting to file storage (AppDataDir).
- Internal PKI CA supports storage module configuration for root/intermediate keys, with PEM encoding and optional custom storage backends.

**Data encryption in transit:**  
- TLS is enforced by default for all qualifying HTTP routes (automatic HTTPS).
- Cipher suites and elliptic curves are selected based on hardware capabilities; strong defaults are used (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519, P256, etc.).
- TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are supported; minimum version is configurable.
- Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) is supported for SNI privacy, with DNS publication of ECH configs.
- Session tickets use rotating random keys for secure session resumption.

**Key management:**  
- Private keys for certificates and CAs are generated using secure cryptographic libraries.
- Session ticket ephemeral keys (STEKs) are rotated at a configurable interval and securely zeroed in memory upon rotation.
- ECH keys are generated, stored, and (in the future) will be automatically rotated.
- CA root/intermediate keys are generated and stored in PEM format; root keys are not cached in memory long-term.

**Secure configuration:**  
- Configuration is validated for duplicate/ambiguous automation policies, invalid listener addresses, and prohibited protocol combinations.
- Sensitive headers (e.g., Authorization, Cookie, Set-Cookie) are redacted in logs unless explicitly allowed.
- Secure defaults for protocol versions, cipher suites, and session ticket management.

**Data handling and storage:**  
- Request and response buffering is configurable, with warnings on unlimited buffering to prevent OOM risks.
- File server module filters hidden files and sensitive configuration files from directory listings.
- PKI module optionally installs root certificates into system trust stores, with checks for existing trust.

## 4. Audit Logging and Monitoring

**Audit logging mechanisms:**  
- Structured logging via zap throughout all major modules (HTTP server, TLS, PKI, reverse proxy, ACME server, tracing).
- Loggable request and response wrappers redact sensitive information by default.
- Debug-level logs provide detailed information for provisioning, certificate management, and proxy operations.

**Log formats and structures:**  
- JSON-structured logs with contextual fields (request, upstream, duration, status codes, errors).
- Administrative actions and errors are logged with details for auditing.

**Log retention policies:**  
- No explicit log retention or rotation policies are defined in code; log management is the responsibility of the deployment environment.

**Monitoring systems:**  
- Prometheus metrics are exposed for both admin API and HTTP endpoints (configurable).
- Metrics include HTTP request counts, request errors, configuration reloads, reverse proxy upstream health, and build/process information.

**Alert mechanisms:**  
- No built-in alerting (e.g., email, webhook) in code; designed for integration with external monitoring/alerting systems via metrics.

**Compliance reporting:**  
- No dedicated compliance reporting features; however, logs and metrics provide necessary data for external compliance and audit tools.
- Input validation and operational errors are logged for post-incident analysis.

**Note:**  
While the service demonstrates strong cryptographic practices and structured logging, critical admin and operational endpoints (such as `/metrics` and `/reverse_proxy/upstreams`) do not have built-in authentication or authorization enforcement, and access controls should be implemented at deployment (e.g., via firewall, network policies, or reverse proxy ACLs). Sensitive information in logs is redacted by default, and session ticket keys and TLS certificates are managed securely. Compliance features such as log retention and access auditing are left to external systems.
